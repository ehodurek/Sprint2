Sprint 2 - OvalDrawPlus

OvalDrawPlus is an application that prints out a filled oval with a filled square behind it onto a seperate popup window.

Credit to Professor Pogue for a large portion of the sample code along with my persoanl tweaks for the assignment.

The build process for this required to make a parents class we pulled our getters and setters in which estalblished our
colors and bounds for the shapes. We pulled in a variety of other methods such as JFrame in order to print the product
onto a seperate window. We then made seperate classes for oval and rectangle and assigned values for colors and sizes.
Those were then called in main class in order to display the product and print out the message in terminal.
